          A Perspective Projection Matrix allows you to define an arbitrary viewing volume, or frustum, that will dictate which objects are displayed on the screen
          and apply a perspective affect that makes objects further away appear smaller than closer ones. Construction of the matrix can be boiled down into several
          computations that the projection matrix is responsible for: remapping eye space coordinates to the range [-1, 1] and projecting coordinates onto the image
          plane. All of which ultimately distort the perspective frustum into the canonical viewing volume. A side effect of the remapping of the z-value means that there
          is a non-linear z-buffer due to the relationship of the z-coordinate from eye space to ndc space(the [-1, 1] range).

        <h2>Things to Know Before Diving in: Conventions</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
          This article is mainly geared towards the commonly used conventions that programmers use 
          when working with OpenGL such as 
          column-major ordering for matrices and RHS(Right Handed System) for coordinate systems.
          So, if you'd like to use the results, just keep in mind that you may need to transpose
          the matrices so they're in row-major ordering instead. Also, if there are any other caveats,
          then they will be discussed in the specific section they apply to. Moreover, it doesn't matter
          which conventions you prefer, just make sure you're consistent with them throughout your program.

        <h2>Projection What?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The first step in determining how to derive the Perspective Projection Matrix is, believe it or not,
          knowing how projection works. You can think of projection as a line starting
          from your eye to a specific point in the scene. This line intersects a plane known as the near
          plane, or image plane, and continues into the scene. Drawing out this concept, we can arrive at something
          that looks like the figures below. Where P is the point in the scene, and P' is the the location of the point
          projected onto the near plane.
        </p>

        <div class="side-by-side-img">
          <img alt="Figure" src="2d_perspective_projection_p_example.png">
          <img alt="Figure" src="2d_perspective_projection_p'_example.png">
        </div>

        <p>
          So how do we determine the coordinates for P'? The slope - though, it is also common to use the law of
          similiar triangles to determine the x and y-values of P'. We know the slope for P is y/z, and since
          our goal is to project this point onto the near plane, we multiply the slope by the z-value at near.
          This looks something like z * (y/z) = P'y. This yields the y-value of P'. A similar process is used to
          obtain the x-value of P'. Now working with the zx-plane, we use the slope x/z and again multiply that
          by the z-value denoted by near, to get z * (x/z) = P'x.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we know how to determine the x and y-values of the projected point: (n * y)/z and (n * x)/z, where n =
          the near plane's z-value. But
          because we also want to deform the Perspective Projection Frustum into the canonical view volume,
          we still need to transform our coordinate values from the range [left, right], [bottom, top], and
          [near, far] to all be within the range: [-1, 1]. Note, we will be using the equations
          defined as -z * (y/-z) = P'y and -z * (x/-z) = P'x since a RHS is being preferred.

            Encoding this equation into the Perspective Projection Matrix, we get something like this.
            I kind like how songho formulated the equation above to make it easier to understand that
            (R+L)/(R-L) goes into the z coordinate spot.

        <h2>Homogeneous Coordinate Trick</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
          An important step in understanding how to create the Perspective Projection matrix is learning what role 
          homogeneous coordinates play. Consider the figures below, you wouldn't be able to create a matrix that
          divides the x, y, and z values by the z-value contained within the point vector because there is no way
          to carry over the point vector's z-value into the result. Pay attention to the values underlined in red.
          We can use  homogeneous coordinates to copy over the z-value so we can later perform the division
          by w(OpenGL does this division by w automatically and is known as Perspective Division). 
          And that's how the 4th row of the matrix is derived. 
        </p>

        <p>
          You may see this matrix with the 4th row defined as 0 0 1 0, which would not flip the
          sign of z_eye when carrying it over to w_clip. Again, this is something that is
          dependent upon whether or not you're working with a RHS or LHS- programmer's choice. If
          you're working with a RHS in OpenGL and are not calling this function like so: glDepthFunc(GL_GREATER).
          Then it's likely that you need the Perspective Projection Matrix to flip the sign of z_eye so that the handedness
          of your coordinate system goes from RHS to LHS since the default OpenGL depth test operator is GL_LESS which means
          that fragments with a smaller depth value will be in front of fragments with a larger depth value; the opposite
          is said for GL_GREATER.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention of Depth Value Loss</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
          Now we have obtained 3 of the 4 rows of the Perspective Projection Matrix.
          Based on our prior observations on projections, we know that
          there's the no relationship between the resulting z_clip value and the x and y-values. Therefore, the first two values
          of the 3rd row are filled with 0s.

        </p>

        <div class="side-by-side-img">
          <img alt="Figure" src="partially_blank_3rd_row_matrix.png">
        </div>

        <p>
           We also know that we want to keep our z-value since it contains useful depth information. So why not just
           fill in the last two elements in the row with -1 and 0 like so? Unfortunately, that would always result in
           the z_clip value being 1- which is not too helpful since information about the original z-value is lost.
        </p>

        <div class="side-by-side-img">
          <img alt="Figure" src="hypothetical_3rd_row_matrix_result.png">
        </div>

        <br>
        <p>
          Instead, the best that can be done is to retain information about the beginning and end range.
          Expanding out the matrix math and solve for the last two elements.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          Fortunately, when the z-value is on the near clipping plane, we know its value will be remapped to -1, and when the
          z-value is on the far clipping plane, its value will be remapped to 1. Keep in mind that the end
          goal is to remap the z_eye value from [n, f] to [-1, 1]. However, the relationship between z_eye and z_ndc is
          [-n, -1] and [-f, 1] even though n and f are specified using positive values. Therefore, -n and -f will be used
          in the equation instead.

        <p>
          This doesn't matter too much with OpenGL since the viewport transform kinda handles it. With OpenGL, you can
          partially define the viewport transform using glViewport(...) and can sorta modify the depth range using
          glDepthRange(...) although any value specified will be clamped to [0, 1].

        <p>
          You can define the Perspective Projection Frustum using left, right, bottom, top, near, and far.
          However, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to provide all of those parameters and instead
          only specify a couple and let math do the rest of the work for us? Yes! So, what we can do is
          make use of trigonometry so we only have to specify the near, far, fovy, and aspect ratio.
