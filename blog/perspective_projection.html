          A perspective projection matrix allows you to define an arbitrary viewing volume, or frustum, that will dictate which objects are displayed on the screen
          and apply a perspective affect that makes objects further away appear smaller than closer ones.
        <p>

        <p>
          This is carried out through the computations contained within a projection matrix:
          <ul>
            <li>1) Perspective transform (Distorting the perspective frustum into a viewing volume that resembles an orthographic projection volume- I think this might include projecting coordinates onto the near plane).</li>
            <li>2) Distorting to the canonical viewing volume by remapping the range to [-1, 1].</li>

        <h2>Projection What?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The first step in determining how to derive the Perspective Projection matrix is, believe it or not,
          knowing how projection works. You can think of projection as a line starting
          from your eye to a specific point in the scene. This line intersects a plane known as the near
          plane, or image plane, and continues into the scene. Drawing out this concept, we can arrive at something
          that looks like the figures below. Where P is the point in the scene, and P' is the the location of the point
          projected onto the near plane.
        </p>

        <div class="side-by-side-img">
          <img alt="Figure" src="Figure3.png">
          <img alt="Figure" src="Figure4.png">
        </div>

        <p>
          So how do we determine the coordinates for P'? The slope - though, it is also common to use the law of
          similiar triangles to determine the x and y-values of P'. We know the slope for P is y/z, and since
          our goal is to project this point onto the near plane, we multiply the slope by the z-value at near.
          This looks something like z * (y/z) = y. This yields the y-value of P'. A similar process is used to
          obtain the x-value of P'. Now working with the zx-plane, we use the slope x/z and again multiply that
          by the z-value denoted by near, to get z * (x/z) = x.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we know how to determine the x and y-values of the projected point: (n * y)/z and (n * x)/z, where n =
          the near projection plane's z-value. But
          because we also want to deform the Perspective Projection Frustum into the canonical view volume,
          we still need to transform our coordinate values from the range [left, right], [bottom, top], and
          [near, far] to [-1, 1], [-1, 1], and [-1, 1] respectively.

        <h2>Homogeneous Coordinate Trick</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          An important step in understanding how to create the Perspective Projection matrix is learning what role 
          homogeneous coordinates play. Consider the figures below, you wouldn't be able to create a matrix that
          divides the x, y, and z values by the z-value contained within the point vector because there is no way
          to carry over the point vector's z-value into the result. Pay attention to the values underlined in red,
          using homogeneous coordinates, which allow us to copy over the z-value so we can later perform the division
          by z(which is now w_clip). And that's how the 4th row of the matrix is derived.
