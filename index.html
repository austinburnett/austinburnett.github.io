                        <p>
                            I'm a software engineer with a passion for backend development, graphics programming, and machine learning. I am
                            always on the lookout
                            for new challenges that can help me grow in my field.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Over the years, I have gained experience in contributing to and implementing complex systems, and I pride
                            myself on being able to work well both independently and as part of a team. I have a keen eye for detail and a
                            drive to constantly improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest industry trends.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My expertise includes working with languages such as Javascript, C++, and Python, as well as experience with
                            databases and cloud services. My approach to software engineering is rooted in the principles of agile
                            development, which allows me to produce high-quality code that meets user needs.
