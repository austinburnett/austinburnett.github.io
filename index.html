        <p>I'm currently a Computer Science major enrolled at the University of Kentucky; ever since my first programming class 
          I have been ecstatic to learn more. I'm passionate about working on software that is impactful and solves real-world problems. In my free time I like working on personal projects, browsing the web for cool open source projects to contribute to, and watching videos about programming. When I'm not absorbed in programming,
          you can find me cooking, binge watching tv series, or playing video games.

        <p>  Recently I was asked a question that I really enjoyed, "What song would you play when you walked into a room?"
          Mine is Livin' Thing by Electric Light Orchestra. What would yours be?</p>

        <h2> <a>Experience</a></h2>

        <p>My most recent experience as a software developer was at Bitwerx, Inc.
           Here, I followed my passion and was able to work on software that impacted Veterinary
           Clinics across the United States. I used <strong>C++</strong> code and <strong>librsync</strong> to upgrade the way we did our
           data migrations. The impact this upgrade had improved the speed of our migrations
           and made them more secure. To test this upgrade, I used <strong>Microsoft Azure Blob Storage</strong> to make sure that
           our data was being properly uploaded to the cloud. Additionally, I worked on reviewing/completing pull requests using <strong>Microsoft Azure Devops</strong>.      
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Prior to the start of my first internship, I wanted to take on the challenge of contributing to a 
          larger codebase. Eventually, I found a cool open-source project to contribute to, couchers.org. During my work
          on this web app I used <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> to add a new feature to the backend that
          sent a notification to users when someone accepted their friend request.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where it all began, my first professional experience as a devloper. During my first semester at the University of Kentucky
          I started working as a Research Assistant in the Computer Science department. Here, I wrote <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>CSS</strong> for
          the Classics in Translation website.
