          I'm a software engineer with a passion for <strong>backend development</strong>, I am always on the lookout for new challenges that can help me grow in my field. My current goal is to deepen my knowledge of distributed systems, as I am convinced that this is the future of software engineering.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the years, I have gained experience in contributing to and implementing complex systems, and I pride myself on being able to work well both independently and as part of a team. I have a keen eye for detail and a drive to constantly improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest industry trends.
          <br> 
          <br>
          My expertise includes working with languages such as Javascript, C++, and Python, as well as experience with databases and cloud services. My approach to software engineering is rooted in the principles of agile development, which allows me to produce high-quality code that meets user needs.
