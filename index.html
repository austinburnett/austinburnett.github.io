          I'm a software engineer with a passion for <strong>backend development</strong>, I am always on the lookout
          for new challenges that can help me grow in my field. My current goal is to deepen my knowledge of <strong>distributed
          systems</strong>, as I am convinced that this is the future of software engineering.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the years, I have gained experience in contributing to and implementing complex systems, and I pride
          myself on being able to work well both independently and as part of a team. I have a keen eye for detail and a
          drive to constantly improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest industry trends.
          <br>
          <br>
          My expertise includes working with languages such as <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, as well as experience with
          <strong>databases</strong> and <strong>cloud services</strong>. My approach to software engineering is rooted in the principles of <strong>agile</strong>
          development, which allows me to produce high-quality code that meets user needs.
